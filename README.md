# Vendor Quote Analysis for Procurement Optimization

This project analyzes supplier quote data to identify inefficiencies in cost, MOQ (minimum order quantity), and lead time. The goal is to assist procurement teams in selecting optimal vendors by highlighting cost anomalies and delays using Excel, Tableau, and optional Python support.

---

## Overview

- Clean and preprocess supplier quote data
- Use Excel and Tableau to explore vendor-wise patterns
- Identify pricing inconsistencies and lead time outliers
- Build dashboards for clear visual insights

---

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel (pivot tables, conditional formatting)
- Tableau Public
- Python (optional analysis with Pandas)

---

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/` – Excel or Python files
- `data/` – Supplier quote dataset
- `dashboards/` – Tableau visualizations
- `visuals/` – Screenshots of dashboards and charts
- `README.md` – This file

---

## Key Highlights

- Found up to 15% cost variation for the same parts across vendors
- Identified suppliers with consistent lead time delays
- Visualized unit cost vs MOQ to detect hidden sourcing costs
- Delivered dashboards to simplify procurement decision-making

---

## Business Insight

Procurement functions often overlook small inefficiencies that add up over time. This project shows how combining structured analysis with visual dashboards can drive smarter vendor selection and cost savings.

## Future Scope

- Automate dashboard refresh using Python
- Connect with live supplier data sources
- Expand dashboard views with category and region filters
