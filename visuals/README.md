Visualization Descriptions
Unit Cost vs. MOQ Scatter Plot (visuals/Unit_Cost_vs_MOQ.png):
Description: A scatter plot with MOQ on the x-axis and Unit_Cost on the y-axis. Points are colored by Vendor_Name and sized by Quality_Rating (larger for higher ratings, 1-5). Uses a professional color palette (deep) and transparency for clarity.
Purpose: Identifies hidden sourcing costs, e.g., Vendor_C offers low unit costs ($15.75 for Widget_Y) but high MOQs (200), while Vendor_D has high costs ($30.00) with moderate MOQs (120).
Insight: Highlights trade-offs for procurement decisions, supporting cost optimization.
Cost Variation by Part Box Plot (visuals/Cost_Variation_by_Part.png):
Description: A box plot showing Unit_Cost distribution for each Part_Number. Each box represents the range, median, and outliers, with a muted color palette for clarity.
Purpose: Visualizes cost variations (up to 20% for parts like P12345, ranging from $24.90 to $30.00) to identify parts needing cost negotiation.
Insight: Confirms your project’s finding of up to 15% cost variation, e.g., P12345 shows significant variability.
Lead Time by Vendor Bar Chart (visuals/Lead_Time_by_Vendor.png):
Description: A bar chart showing average Lead_Time_Days per Vendor_Name, with a red dashed line at the overall average (~14.75 days). Uses the viridis palette for professional styling.
Purpose: Identifies vendors with delays, e.g., Vendor_D’s average lead time (~19.5 days) exceeds the average.
Insight: Flags Vendor_D and Vendor_B for consistent delays, aligning with your goal to optimize supplier selection.
